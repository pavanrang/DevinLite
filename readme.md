# DevinLite

DevinLite is a simplified AI-powered software development pipeline inspired by the concept of "Devin", an AI software engineer. This project demonstrates how multiple AI agents can collaborate to solve programming tasks, simulating a complete software development lifecycle. DevinLite is a simplified version and may not handle extremely complex tasks. It's designed as a demonstration and learning tool for AI-assisted software development.

## Overview

DevinLite uses the CrewAI framework to orchestrate a team of AI agents, each specializing in different aspects of software development:

1. Software Architect
2. Software Programmer
3. Software Tester
4. Software Reviewer

These agents work together to take a user-defined problem and produce a solution, including architecture design, implementation, testing, and code review.

## Features

- **AI-Driven Development**: Utilizes advanced language models to power each agent.
- **Full Development Lifecycle**: Covers architecture, implementation, testing, and review.
- **Flexible Problem Solving**: Can tackle a wide range of programming tasks based on user input.
- **Tool Integration**: Includes tools for file operations and web searches to assist the AI agents.
