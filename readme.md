# DevinLite

DevinLite is a simplified AI-powered software development pipeline inspired by the concept of "Devin", an AI software engineer. This project demonstrates how multiple AI agents can collaborate to solve programming tasks, simulating a complete software development lifecycle. DevinLite is a simplified version and may not handle extremely complex tasks. It's designed as a demonstration and learning tool for AI-assisted software development.

## Overview

DevinLite uses the CrewAI framework to orchestrate a team of AI agents, each specializing in different aspects of software development:

1. Software Architect: Designs the architecture of the solution based on the user input.
2. Software Programmer: Writes code as per the architecture design.
3. Software Tester: Tests the implemented solution to ensure it meets the requirements and is free of bugs.
4. Software Reviewer: Reviews the architecture, implementation, and test results to provide a comprehensive analysis.

These agents work together to take a user-defined problem and produce a solution, including architecture design, implementation, testing, and code review.

## Features

- **AI-Driven Development**: Utilizes advanced large language models to power each agent.
- **Full Development Lifecycle**: Covers architecture, implementation, testing, and review.
- **Flexible Problem Solving**: Can tackle a wide range of programming tasks based on user input.
- **Tool Integration**: Includes tools for file operations and web searches to assist the AI agents.
